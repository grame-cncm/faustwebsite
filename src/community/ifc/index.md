# International Faust Conference (IFC)

The International Faust Conference (IFC) takes place every two year. It aims at 
gathering developers and users of the Faust programming language to present 
current projects and discuss future directions for Faust and its community.

Participants share their work through paper presentations. A series of round 
tables on various topics serve as a platform to brainstorm on Faust's features, 
semantics, tools, applications, etc. to determine future directions for this 
language. Open spaces for demos and workshops are usually available for 
participants to openly share their ongoing projects with the rest of the 
community.
