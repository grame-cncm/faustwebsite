## Expression of Interest for the Creation of a Faust Consortium  

Dear Sir or Madam,  

After more than twenty years of research and development led by [Grame](https://www.grame.fr), the National Center for Music Creation in Lyon, the [Faust programming language](https://faust.grame.fr) has become a mature and stable software, widely used by an international community of developers, industry professionals, and academic researchers, particularly in the field of electronic musical instruments and audio software. Additionally, Faust is taught at prestigious universities, further strengthening its academic recognition and global influence.  
Faust stands out due to several key qualities:  

- **A high-level language**, designed to express complex digital audio processing in a concise and efficient manner.  
- **Advanced compilation techniques and highly efficient code generation**, ensuring the transformation of source code into high-performance implementations across a wide range of platforms.  
- **A set of libraries composed of specialized DSP building blocks**, progressively contributed by the user community, allowing for rapid prototyping of sophisticated programs in just a few lines of code.  
- **A rich ecosystem**, enabling the deployment of the same program across a wide variety of architectures, from specialized audio boards to plugins or standalone applications on computers, all the way to web platforms.  

To structure this community and ensure the long-term development of Faust, we are pleased to present the project for the creation of the Faust Consortium, managed by [**INRIA**](https://inria.fr/en). This letter aims to gauge the interest of industrial stakeholders and academic partners in such a consortium, which would bring together companies, universities, and organizations wishing to play an active role in the evolution of Faust.  

The Faust Consortium will ensure that Faust remains an open-source project, accessible to all, while securing its sustainable development and long-term stability.  

As a member of the Faust Consortium, you will have the opportunity to:  

- **Participate in strategic decisions**, including defining the roadmap for the language and its ecosystem.  
- **Benefit from personalized technical support**, tailored to your membership level (Silver, Gold, Platinum).  
- **Contribute to the long-term maintenance** of Faust by pooling resources to ensure its sustainable development.  
- **Join a dynamic network of industry, research, and academic stakeholders**, fostering synergies and collaborations.  

The Consortium is structured around a General Assembly, responsible for overall governance, and a Scientific and Technical Committee that defines and updates the technical roadmap.  

We would be delighted to hear about your interest and that of your organization in this project and to count you among the future members of the Faust Consortium. Please feel free to contact us for further information or to arrange a meeting to discuss the membership details.  

We look forward to your response.  

Sincerely,  

On behalf of the Faust Consortium,
