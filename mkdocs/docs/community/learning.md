## TU Berlin

The regular [sound synthesis class](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/vergangene_semester/sommersemester_2020/sound_synthesis/) at the Audio Communication Group, TU Berlin, makes use of Faust for exploring the basics of different synthesis algorithms. Student projects based on Faust include Eurorack modules, standalone drum machines and synthesizers, as well as data sonification approaches. The class is taught by [Henrik von Coler](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/wissenschaftliche_mitarbeiter/henrik_von_coler/), who is director of the Electronic Studio at the TU.

## HPI Potsdam

The class [Data Sonification & Opportunities of Sound](https://hpi.de/en/studies/courses/data-engineering-ma/course/wise-20-21-3154-data-sonification--opportunities-of-sound.html) at Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam Potsdam, is an interdisciplinary format, exploring the use of sonification and sound synthesis in the context of design thinking, neurosience and medical applications. The signal processing part is taught by [Henrik von Coler](http://hvc.berlin/about/).

## [Université Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr)
A 24 hours introduction to Faust is given by [Alain Bonardi](http://alainbonardi.net) during the first semester to undergraduated students (L3, 3rd year after the french 'baccalauréat') in the framework of the course "Programming Languages in Computer Music 1" offered in the "Music creation with computers" minor.
