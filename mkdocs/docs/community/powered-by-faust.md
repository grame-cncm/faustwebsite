Wam-Studio’s is an online tool for creating audio projects that you can imagine as multi-track music. Each track corresponds to a different "layer" of audio content that can be recorded, edited, or just integrated (using audio files for example). Some track can be used to control virtual instruments: in that case we record the sound that is generated internally by these virtual instruments (and played using a MIDI piano keyboard, for example). 

Tracks can be added or removed, played isolated or with other tracks. They can also be "armed" for recording, and when the recording starts, all other tracks will play along, while the armed track will record new content. 

Wam-Studio can host [WAM plugins](https://github.com/webaudiomodules) and in particular [Faust ones](https://github.com/webaudiomodules/wam-examples), which can be built following [this tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDEm4m_cD47YBuDilzGYiANYQDktj56Njyv0umGYO6o/edit#heading=h.lhqrbk1zktwy).

### [Sentinelle](https://framagit.org/jeromeabel/sentinelle)

[Sentinelle](https://jeromeabel.net/workshop/sentinelle/) is a sound and robotic art installation made by [Jérôme Abel](https://jeromeabel.net/). A robot-probe is placed in a dark place, a cellar. It scans its surroundings with two lasers. The reliefs of the old walls, their imperfections, mold, appear thanks to the perfectly straight lines of the lasers. Its movements are synchronized with a sound program. From these very simple visual and sound choreographies are born an imaginary on its functioning and the origin of its presence. The spectator observes in a mirror a robot which observes and testifies. Does it communicate with other systems? Does it send information? Its energy is precious, like a heartbeat or a breath, it works in a segmented way with periods of silence. Likewise, his movements are slow and relentless.

Faust objects from [https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/examples](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/examples) included with [pd-faustgen](https://github.com/agraef/pd-faustgen):

### [arco4 - sound synthesis engine and framework](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/arco)

Arco is a sound synthesis engine that offers dynamic patching of of unit generators. It is designed to operate as a small embedded server, running either in its own process or within an application. In the spirit of "smaller is better," Arco DSP is mainly [delegated to FAUST](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/arco/blob/main/doc/building.md#defining-a-new-ugen-using-faust), leveraging a wide range of existing algorithms. Arco control is delegated to external languages connecting through O2, which supports running Arco within the same application, in a separate process or even on a remote networked host. Arco should be a nice alternative to libpd as an embedded sound engine. The author is mainly using Arco in tandem with Serpent, a real-time Python-like scripting language, but other language bindings are possible.

### [Synthesizer-synthesizer](https://gitlab.com/dhuck/synthesis-synthesis)

This is a dual-course project for CS378 NLP and CS393P. The goal is to use language model guided program synthesis to synthesize Faust DSP code to ... automatically program synthesizers. Not guaranteed to work. In the slightest.

### [Ambisonics in KMH studios and Lilla salen](https://github.com/friskgit/kmh_ls)

The general idea behind using ambisonics for diffusing sounds in a space is to, in the first stage, encode an audio signal to a representation of a sound field - a B-format signal. This B-format signal is independent of whatever speaker array the signal will later be diffused on. In the second stage the B-format signal is decoded to the layout of a particular speaker array. In between these two stages a number of transformations may be applied, but the sound source specification may conveniently be specified in the encoder. The decoders are written in Faust.

### [Brainwave Virtual Instrument](https://github.com/nicodaleman/brainwave_virtual_instrument)

<div><a href="https://github.com/nicodaleman/brainwave_virtual_instrument"><img width="40%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/BVIGUI.png"></a>  </div>

The Brainwave Virtual Instrument (BVI) is an open-source software synthesizer built in the programming language Faust. Its purpose is to facilitate the exploration of electroencephalogram (EEG) and other brain data through sonification. Pre-recorded data is translated as parameter controls of the instrument in the form of Open Source Control (OSC) messages that are generated and streamed by a small python program.

The instrument can easily be distributed and compiled to different targets thanks to Faust’s flexibility. Frequency Modulation synthesis provides a comprehensive approach to textural parameters of sounds, so that musical composition and improvisation based on a creative use of brain data become feasible. This is exemplified by the Brainwave Etudes (BE), a series of compositions inspired by measurements of brain activity during different states of mind.

The BVI was created for two major purposes: on the one hand, to find musical structures that relate to each other in order to present an aesthetic proposal, and on the other, to create a tool that familiarizes scientists and researchers in the field of neuroscience with sonification techniques, and the exploration of brain activity through sound. An extended presentation of the system can be found in this [IFC 2020 paper](https://ifc20.sciencesconf.org/332720/document).

Processing effect is written in Faust programming language and compiled into C code. So far the Cortex M4 core clocked at 204 MHz has proven to be capable of executing relatively complex effects like wah, but effect-chaining quickly reaches the limits of processing power.


### [Tambura](https://github.com/olilarkin/Tambura)

<div><a href="https://github.com/olilarkin/Tambura"><img width="50%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/Tambura.png"></a>  </div>

Waveguide physical model of an Indian Tambura/Tanpura. This is a Faust patch inspired by the Indian Tambura/Tanpura - a four string drone instrument, known for its unique rich harmonic timbre.

The model uses a few tricks to produce a Tambura-like sound, and should probably be referred to as a "pseudo" physical model, because it does not attempt to accurately recreate the physics of the string-bridge interaction. It includes a range of parameters selected to allow control of the qualities of the excitation/pluck, string behavior and sympathetic resonance. It can produce some beautiful evolving drones, which can vary from very synthetic to quite natural. The model can be [tested here](https://olilarkin.github.io/Tambura/).


### [Granola](https://github.com/jlp6k/faust-things)

### [b259wf](https://github.com/yorgoszachos/b259wf)

<div><a href="https://github.com/yorgoszachos/b259wf"><img width="40%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/b259wf.png"></a>  </div>

This is a model of the "tibre" circuit of the Buchla 259 Complex Wave Generator, made in [Faust](http://faust.grame.fr/). The model follows the circuit modelling
as seen on the paper  [Virtual Analog Buchkla 259 wavefolder](http://www.dafx17.eca.ed.ac.uk/papers/DAFx17_paper_82.pdf), using 5 folds.

The proposed 2-point BLAMP antialiasing method has been attempted for arbitrary sources as shown [here](http://dafx16.vutbr.cz/dafxpapers/18-DAFx-16_paper_33-PN.pdf), but it is
not sufficient for high frequencies and/or more complex signals. Instead, filtering and light cubic nonlinearity distiorion has been used to round corners and for
clipping.

The user interface consists of the controls **fold** for the folding amount, **offset** for offseting the signal before folding, and **lowpass** as a final stage one-pole filtering to control the character (too much folding might introduce unwanted higher harmonics for certain signals). The final output is dc-blocked.


### [string-machine](https://github.com/jpcima/string-machine)

<div><a href="https://github.com/jpcima/string-machine"><img width="70%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/string-machine.png"></a>  </div>

This is a virtual-analog string ensemble synthesizer. The implementation is based on a digital model designed by Peter Whiting. The improvement of the model adds various abilities, in particular a virtual-analog emulation of the bucket brigade delay circuit. Most of the [DSP code](https://github.com/jpcima/string-machine/tree/master/sources/dsp) is developed using Faust. Three VST or LV2 are generated: **string-machine**, **string-machine-chorus** and **string-machine-chorus-stereo**.


### [metaFx](https://github.com/dblanchemain/metaFx)

<div><a href="https://github.com/dblanchemain/metaFx"><img width="35%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/metaFx.png"></a>  </div>

The [metaFx](http://blanchemain.info/Documents/Programmation/index.php?page=metaFx) is a control surface for continuous sound transformations in real time, just like the metaSurface64.

Like [metaSurface64](https://faust.grame.fr/community/made-with-faust/#metasurface64), it has both its own loop generator and a multi-effects FX engine, but its operation is different, especially for the management of plugin chains and pads.

Each mixer on this surface can directly control the gain and the attached plug-ins. It is also possible to control the tracks of an external sequencer (Ardour or Reaper). To do this, the application uses OSC controllable modules that come from the Faust language library that is embedded in the application. Its interest lies in the construction of a parallel sound processing chain in the form of a graph.

### [Virtual Rhizome](https://www.vrcarinola.com/virtual-rhizome)

<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGZB44KI9Y0"><img width="60%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/virtual-rhizome.png"></a>  </div>

By [Vincent Carinola](https://www.vrcarinola.com). [Virtual Rhizome](https://www.vrcarinola.com/virtual-rhizome) responds to a proposal by [Christophe Lebreton and Jean Geoffroy](https://www.lisilog.com/shc/) to compose a work for the original Smart Hand Computer system, developed at the GRAME-CNCM using the Faust language and allowing to play smartphones as an instrument.

The work takes the form of a labyrinth, a kind of virtual architecture that could be compared to Borges' "garden of branching paths", within which the musician evolves by adapting his gestures to the constraints of different types of situations. Each situation is characterized by an autonomous functioning of the system, that the musician must apprehend in order to find the key allowing him to modify it and to move towards another situation. But in order to orientate himself well, he must create a mental representation of the structure of the work. The performer then becomes an explorer of a world that he unveils, but isn't that what he has always been?

Virtual rhizome owes much to the availability and enthusiasm of Jean Geoffroy and Christophe Lebreton. It is amicably dedicated to them.


### [SmartFaust](https://www.grame.fr/articles/smartfaust-5d839e9c3a877)

<div><a href="https://www.grame.fr/articles/smartfaust-5d839e9c3a877"><img width="50%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/smartfaust.jpg"></a>  </div>

SmartFaust is a concept of musical applications for smartphones. These applications have the particularity of only using the user's gestures and not by tapping on the device's screen. Made for iOS and Android, they can also use the motion sensors of these devices to make them real musical instruments.

Smartfaust applications are based on the Faust (Functional Audio Stream) programming language developed by Grame over the last 15 years and recognized as a standard in the field of real-time signal processing for audio.

The SmartFaust applications were first used for the creation of the pieces Mephisto (for drums and cell phone ensemble), Belzebuth (participative piece for public equipped with Smartphones), Iblis (for clarinet and cell phone ensemble) and Bélial (for harp and cell phone ensemble) written by the composer Xavier Garcia.

From this same technology were later created the applications "Geek Bagatelles" (2016) and "GameLan" (2019).

### [Trombone Simulator](https://nuchi.github.io/trombone/)

<div><a href="https://nuchi.github.io/trombone/"><img width="60%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/trombone.jpg"></a>  </div>

This simulator is a physical model of a trombone. Physical models of the lips, mouthpiece, slide, and bell are digitally simulated. The controls are listed at the top. The main controls are to move the cursor (or your finger on a touch device) left and right on the picture to adjust the embouchure, and up and down to extend and retract the slide. The diagonal colored lines are a guide to where the resonances are: playing over a resonance means that the embouchure and slide length are matched. Playing over white space means that one is between resonances and the note quality won't be as good. The big gray wedge on the upper right indicates that the resonances are very close together there. The vertical dashed lines indicate the rough locations of B-flat (thick lines) and F (thin lines). Other notes are unmarked, and likewise the slide positions. (Just like on a real trombone!) The off-key resonances (7th, 11th, 13th, and 14th) are marked in red. The g and f keys can be used to growl and flutter-tongue, respectively.

The audio simulation is written in Faust, which conveniently compiles to WebAssembly and a Web Audio API wrapper. The overall approach used was a digital waveguide model, as described in J. O. Smith III's Digital Waveguide Theory. The lips and bell are adapted from F. Scott's masters thesis.


### [Integrating 1-DoF force feedback interactions in self-contained DMIs](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644x49k)

<div><a href="https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644x49k"><img width="50%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/thesis-kirkegaard.png"></a>  </div>

By [Mathias Kirkegaard](http://www-new.idmil.org/people/mathias-kirkegaard/). This thesis presents a system for designers of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) to explore the integration of 1 degree of freedom (DoF) force feedback interactions in new self-contained instruments. The system developed consists of an open-source graphical tool and a rotary force-feedback device made from commercially available components to facilitate the authoring of audio-haptic applications. Implementing an early prototype is used to inform the development of the graphical editing tool and its integration in an embedded audio-haptic environment using the functional programming language Faust for real-time signal processing.

### [The Striso board](https://www.striso.org)

<a href="https://www.striso.org"><img width="50%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/striso.jpg"></a>

The Striso board is a very expressive music instrument which combines multidimensionally sensitive keys with an innovative note layout that helps understand the structures in music. The keys capture each subtle finger movement, which allows for levels of musical expression previously only known to acoustic instruments. Additionally, accents and sound effects can be added by shaking and moving the instrument as a whole.

The internal sound is written in Faust, and is controlled directly by the signals from the keys and motion sensor. External synthesizers can be controlled using MPE MIDI, or using OSC which is easier to set up for Faust synthesizers. The [firmware source code](https://github.com/striso/striso-control-firmware) is released as open source.


### [Live concatenative granular processing](https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/concatenative_granulation)

<a href="https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/concatenative_granulation"><img width="40%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/concatenative-granular.png"></a>

Reverb Design is about creating a spacial impression aimed at sweetening the listening experience for a given context. The ambiguity of auditory and visual cues in reproduced sound makes it necessary to create an auditory illusion: To make this illusion work, I propose an aesthetic concept of simplicity and intelligibility based on psychoacoustic facts and recording practice as professional producer.

### [FaucK](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/fauck/)

<a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/fauck/"><img class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/fauck.jpg" alt="Card image cap"></a>

FaucK is a Chugin allowing to combine the powerful, succinct Functional AUdio STream (Faust) language with the strongly-timed ChucK audio programming language. FaucK allows programmers to on-the-fly evaluate Faust code directly from ChucK code and control Faust signal processors using ChucK's sample-precise timing and concurrency mechanisms. The goal is to create an amalgam that plays to the strengths of each language, giving rise to new possibilities for rapid prototyping, interaction design and controller mapping, pedagogy, and new ways of working with both Faust and ChucK.

<a href="https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/"><img width="60%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/pure.jpg" alt="Card image cap"></a>

Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation, lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code. It has been created by Albert Gräf.

[pd-faust](https://github.com/agraef/pure-lang/wiki/Addons#pd-faust) is a collection of Pd objects written using pd-pure which lets you run Faust programs inside Pd. It combines the functionality of pure-faust and faust2pd in a single package, and also features dynamic reloading of Faust plugins, automatic generation of controller GUIs and MIDI/OSC controller mappings, as well as OSC-based controller automation. It thus provides a complete solution for interactively developing Faust dsps in Pd.
