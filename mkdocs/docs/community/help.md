# Getting Help

## Faust Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are by far the best way to reach out to the Faust community. If you have a question about the Faust language, the use of one of its associated tools (e.g., FaustLive, the web editor, etc.), or if you just want to follow the latest Faust news, please subscribe and ask your question to:

* [**the Faust Users Mailing List**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/lists/faudiostream-users)

If you'd like to follow the development of Faust and of its associated tools and/or if you wish to contribute to it, please subscribe and ask your question to:

* [**the Faust Developers Mailing List**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/lists/faudiostream-devel) 

## Faust slack channel

Slack is probably the fastest way to get help with Faust: <https://faustaudio.slack.com>.

## Faust discord channel

The [Audio Programmer community](https://theaudioprogrammer.com/community) has a #faust channel.
