## What is Faust?

Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. created at the [GRAME-CNCM Research Department](https://www.grame.fr/recherche).

</figure>

Faust targets high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and standards.

The core component of Faust is its compiler. It allows to "translate" any Faust digital signal processing (DSP) specification to a wide range of non-domain specific languages such as C++, C, LLVM bit code, WebAssembly, Rust, etc. In this regard, Faust can be seen as an alternative to C++ but is much simpler and intuitive to learn.

Thanks to a wrapping system called "architectures," codes generated by Faust can be easily compiled into a wide variety of objects ranging from audio plug-ins to standalone applications or smartphone and web apps, etc.

## Faust News

### **>>** September 09, 2023: faust-web-component released !

Result of [Ian Clester](https://ijc8.me/2023/08/27/gsoc-faust/) Google Summer of Code project, the [faust-web-component](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust-web-component) package provides two web components for embedding interactive Faust snippets in web pages.

- `<faust-editor>` displays an editor (using [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/)) with executable, editable Faust code, along with some bells & whistles (controls, block diagram, plots) in a side pane.
This component is ideal for demonstrating some code in Faust and allowing the reader to try it out and tweak it themselves without having to leave the page, and can [been tested here](https://codepen.io/St-phane-Letz/pen/YzdZZoK). 

- `<faust-widget>` just shows the controls and does not allow editing, so it serves simply as a way to embed interactive DSP, and can [been tested here](https://codepen.io/St-phane-Letz/pen/LYMWybP).

These components are built on top of [faustwasm](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustwasm) and [faust-ui](https://github.com/Fr0stbyteR/faust-ui) packages and is released as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/faust-web-component).


### **>>** September 06, 2023: faust2rnbo released !

<div><a href="https://faustdoc.grame.fr/tutorials/rnbo/"><img  width="40%" class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/faust-rnbo1.png"></a>  </div>
</center>

The [faust2rnbo](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/architecture/max-msp#faust2rnbo) tool transforms a Faust DSP program into a [RNBO](https://rnbo.cycling74.com) patch containing a rnbo~ object and including the codebox code as a subpatch. The  tool has been deployed on the Faust remote compilation service, to be used from the [Faust Web IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr).

All is explained in [Using Faust in RNBO with codebox~](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/tutorials/rnbo/) tutorial and can be used with the just released [Max 8.5.6 version](https://cycling74.com/forums/max-856-released).

</center>

- **Automatic Differentiation in the Faust Compiler** aimed at adding Automatic differentiation directly in the compiler, so that gradient calculation can be carried out natively in Faust, with applications in Machine Learning algorithms. The project was worked  by [Thomas Rushton](https://github.com/hatchjaw) and completed with this [Pull Request](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/pull/939), and finally integrated in the Faust [master-branch](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/commit/681a303b8ddc9ef2e67c2cc5d5df83f27323b865). 

- **Better Faust on the Web** aimed at enhancing Faust’s support for the web platform, and was worked on by [Ian Clester](https://ijc8.me/). Transitioning the Faust web tools to a rewritten TypeScript version has been completed and deployed in updated versions of the [Faust editor](https://fausteditor.grame.fr) and [Faust playground](https://faustplayground.grame.fr) and soon in the [Faust Web IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr) with this [Pull Request](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustide/pull/72). A Faust web component embedding the libfaust JS/WebAssembly compiler has been [developed](https://github.com/ijc8/faust-web-component) and will be used soon in the [Faust documentation](https://faustdoc.grame.fr). The development is fully detailed in this [blog post](https://ijc8.me/2023/08/27/gsoc-faust/). 

Thanks Thomas Rushton and Ian Clester for the hard work during the three months period, and [Agathe Herrou](https://github.com/aherrou), [David Braun](https://github.com/DBraun) and [Jason Freeman](https://distributedmusic.gatech.edu/jason/) for helping mentoring the two projects.

Faust has been used for the physical modeling of musical instruments for many years now. Various tools have been developed recently to address the needs of various modeling techniques (e.g., finite difference scheme, waveguides, mass interaction, etc.).

The goal of this one day workshop was to provide a series of interactive one-hour tutorials on these tools as well as some background on their related modeling techniques.

It took place online on Feb. 1, 2021, 3-9pm GMT+1. Additional information about this event can be found [here](community/events.md#faust-physical-modeling-workshop).

### **>>** FAST Project: Fast Audio Signal Processing Technologies on FPGA

The [FAST project](https://fast.grame.fr/) will start in March 2021! It is funded by the [Agence Nationale de la Recherche](https://anr.fr/) (ANR -- the French National Research Agency). It gathers the strength of [GRAME-CNCM](https://www.grame.fr/), [CITI Lab (INSA Lyon)](http://www.citi-lab.fr/), and [LMFA (École Centrale Lyon)](http://lmfa.ec-lyon.fr/?lang=en) towards two goals:

* facilitate the design of ultra-low latency embedded systems for real-time audio signal processing,
* use such systems in the context of active control of acoustics.

Faust will play a central role in this project.
