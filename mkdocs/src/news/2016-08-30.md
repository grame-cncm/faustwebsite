“**Sound Programming using FAUST**”, written by _Jin-Wook Chae_, an experienced audio developer and sound engineer (right) and _Hyun-Hoo Jung_ (left), is the very first book ever published on FAUST.

While the book is written in Korean, I was able to really appreciate the choice of the examples and the elegance as well as the high quality of the code. I am sure it will be an invaluable tool to promote FAUST in Korea among sound engineering, computer music students and more generally any person interested in sound programming. 

>This book is for people desiring to produce musical instruments or sound processors. I have always been instructing my students that the ultimate importance is to discover interesting ideas about the sound. In spite of that, I have often relied on an unflattering response such as "you may need to learn a programming language like C/C++..." when a student asked for help with how to execute his/her ideas related to sound.
>
>Now I am pleased to recommend the use of FAUST to bring such ideas into execution. This is an easy self-study guide that can help to do just that. Now I can confidently tell anybody pursuing sound or electronic music that their exciting and brilliant idea about sound is what truly counts!
>
>So, really, how do we execute our ideas? Today I am introducing you to FAUST and to this book which you will find immensely helpful in terms of how to use FAUST to bring your fabulous ideas into reality.
