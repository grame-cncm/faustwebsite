### Faust Award 2018 to [iPlug 2](https://github.com/iplug2)

The **Faust Award 2018** was attributed by an international committee composed of :

- Jean-Louis Giavitto (IRCAM, Paris, France),
- Albert Graef (Johannes Gutenberg U., Mainz, Germany), 
- Pierre Jouvelot (Ecole des Mines, Paris, France), 
- Victor Lazzarini (Maynooth U., Maynooth, Ireland), 
- Romain Michon (Stanford U., Palo Alto, USA)
- Yann Orlarey (GRAME, Lyon, France), 
- Laurent Pottier (U. Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne, France),
- Julius Smith (Stanford U., Palo Alto, USA)

to [iPlug 2](https://github.com/iplug2) a free open source C++ audio plug-in framework, allowing developers to create audio plug-ins and apps across a wide range of formats from the same code, including graphical user interface and DSP components. Amongst many other new features and a reworked code base, version 2 includes support for FAUST, allowing sections of audio DSP to be implemented using the FAUST language, and easily integrated with other C++ elements.

[iPlug 2](https://github.com/iplug2) is developed by Oliver Larkin and Alex Harker from the original iPlug, by Cockos inc. that was open sourced in 2008. The project is under active development and will be publicly released at the end of 2018. 

The jury praised the quality, the ambition, and the usefulness of [iPlug 2](https://github.com/iplug2) as a Faust development framework! Check the [demo here](https://youtu.be/AlDw6iCD-7Y). We hope that the Faust Award will help the authors to fully finalize the project.

### Faust Student Software Competition to [Cloud Generator](https://github.com/visstup/cloud-generator)

In parallel to the main competition, the *Faust Student Software Competition*, is intended to promote small, but innovative Faust applications, typically developed in the framework of student projects.

The *student prize 2018* was awarded to [Cloud Generator](https://github.com/visstup/cloud-generator) a nine-voice polyphonic synthesizer developed by Rittik Wystup. 

The jury praised the audio quality and the care taken by Rittik Wystup in his project! Check the Cloud Generator [demo here](https://youtu.be/3uzxZlojxuI).
