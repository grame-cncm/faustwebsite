## **2015-11-15:** New Faust online course

We're happy to announce Romain Michon's [new Faust online course](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustWorkshops/course2015/) based on the "Audio Plug-Ins Designed with Faust workshop" that took place at CCRMA (Stanford University) on July 6-10 2015. 

It aims at giving a broad introduction to digital signal processing and to the Faust programming language. By the end of this course, students should have a full collection of plug-ins usable in various DAWs and computer music environments. While previous experience in programming is helpful but not required to take this course, we expect students to have basic notions of algebra, calculus and to have some experience using computers to make music.
