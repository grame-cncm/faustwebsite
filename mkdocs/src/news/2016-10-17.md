## **2016-10-17:** Faust Award 2016

*The Faust Open Source Software Competition aims at promoting innovative high-quality free audio software developed with Faust, a functional programming language for realtime signal processing and sound synthesis. The competition is sponsored by [GRAME](http://www.grame.fr), Centre National de Création Musicale*

### Faust Award 2016 to [Ambitools](http://www.sekisushai.net/ambitools/)

The **Faust Award 2016** was attributed by an international committee composed of :

- Jean-Louis Giavitto (IRCAM, Paris, France),
- Albert Graef (Johannes Gutenberg U., Mainz, Germany), 
- Pierre Jouvelot (Ecole des Mines, Paris, France), 
- Victor Lazzarini (Maynooth U., Maynooth, Ireland), 
- Romain Michon (Stanford U., Palo Alto, USA)
- Yann Orlarey (GRAME, Lyon, France), 
- Dave Phillips (musician, journalist, and educator, USA)
- Laurent Pottier (U. Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne, France),
- Julius Smith (Stanford U., Palo Alto, USA)


to [Ambitools](http://www.sekisushai.net/ambitools/), a set of tools for real-time 3D sound field synthesis using higher order ambisonics (HOA). 

Ambitools is developed by Pierre Lecomte, a PhD candidate at Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers and Sherbrooke University. The core of the sound processing is written in Faust. The tools contain HOA encoders, decoders, binaural-filters, HOA signals transformations, spherical VU-Meter, etc. and can be compiled in various plug-ins format under Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. 

The jury praised the quality and the usefulness of Ambitools: a *really useful and technically advanced Faust app* and *an impressive technical achievement* ! Check the [demo](http://www.sekisushai.net/ambitools/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Demo_ambitools.mp4).


The committee was also very impressed by the quality of two other projects :

- [Voice of Faust](https://github.com/magnetophon/VoiceOfFaust), a voice synthesizer/effects machine by Bart Brouns ([demo](https://magnetophon.github.io/VoiceOfFaust/images/VoiceOfFaust.mp4)).
- [PMix](https://github.com/olilarkin/pMix2), a graphical patcher, preset interpolator and JIT compiler for FAUST by Oliver Larkin  ([demo](https://vimeo.com/122268573)).

### Faust Student Software Competition to [TouchVoices](https://patheo.github.io/TouchVoices/)

In parallel to the main competition, we introduced this year a junior competition: the **Faust Student Software Competition**, intended to promote small but interesting Faust applications, typically written as student projects.

The **student prize** was awarded to [TouchVoices](https://patheo.github.io/TouchVoices/) (by Pierre-Adrien Théo, RIM Master student at University Jean Monnet) a real-time web application allowing to capture, playback and transform sound loops. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EljDv-mwKW4) of Pierre-Adrien Théo during a performance with [TouchVoices](https://patheo.github.io/TouchVoices/).

A very close competitor was [SuperBeatRepeater](https://github.com/sonejostudios/SuperBeatRepeater) (by Vincent Rateau, of _SuperDirt_ fame), a sample accurate beat repeater. Don't miss the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C38gep4vkm8&feature=youtu.be&t=6m17s)!
