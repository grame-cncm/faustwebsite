Faustgen~ is an external object with the FAUST just-in-time (JIT) compiler embedded that allows to load, compile and play FAUST files within the audio programming environment [Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html).

The FAUST JIT compiler - built with [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) - brings together the convenience of a standalone interpreted language with the efficiency of a compiled language. The faustgen~ object for Pure Data is a very first version with elementary features, help and contributions are more than welcome. The faustgen~ object is available for Linux, Mac and Windows (64-bit) via Deken (v0.4.1) or via the github repository: https://github.com/CICM/pd-faustgen/releases.

We hope that you'll enjoy this project!
