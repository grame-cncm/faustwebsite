GRAME - Centre National de Creation Musicale - is happy to announce [faustgen~](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream/files/), the Faust compiler embedded as a Max/MSP external, available for OSX and Windows.

Thanks to the awesome [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org) technology combined with **libfaust**, the new library version of the Faust compiler, Faust DSP programs can now directly be compiled and executed on the fly at full speed. The Faust DSP source, compiled by libfaust using the LLVM backend, produces an intermediate representation (as LLVM IR), to be compiled  and executed as native machine code directly in memory (using LLVM JIT technology).

The LLVM IR can itself be optimized (using "optimization passes" in LLVM terminology), and the JIT component can be configurated to produce the best possibly native machine code.

This compilation chain has been experimented in faustgen~, an external for Max/MSP. Faustgen~ allows to easily use Faust source code inside a Max/MSP patcher, edit it, change compilation options, and even produce the processor flow chart as an SVG diagram. Preliminary tests show that the resulting native code runs at speed comparable to what the previous static compilation model was achieving. 

Here is a screen shot of a simple Max/MSP patch including a faustgen~ object containing the classical Freeverb Faust DSP code:

For Pure Data, Albert Graef [pd-faust](http://docs.pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pd-faust.html) dynamic environment can be used. We hope similar implementations will be available in the future for Supercollider and Csound.
